It seems that IRR is higher than it should be -- many early subjects were not actually double-entered but instead have exactly the same marks in both julian's and rachel's datasets (extremely unlikely). I will need to ID rows that are perfectly identical and ask Rachel to do them again.

Might not be a bad idea to use tapply(FUN=diff) or dcast(FUN=diff) to look for unusually discrepant codings.
