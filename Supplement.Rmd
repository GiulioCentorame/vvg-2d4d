<!--- This is a chore because broom::tidy doesn't work on censReg objects, so I can't use hilgard::report_t() --->

###Censored regression. 
To attempt to ameliorate the potential ceiling effect, a censored regression model was fit with the ‘censReg’ package for R (Henningsen, 2013). This fits a censored-regression Tobit model and attempts to model values that exceed the maximum of the scale.

```{r}
summary(censModel1)
summary(censModel1.1)
summary(censModel2)
summary(censModel2.1)
```

As before, the analysis found no significant effects of violence, difficulty, 2D4D, or any higher-order interaction.

<!-- Why does 2d4d blow out the scale of OR? -->
###Logistic regression. 
Another possibility is that participants completed the coldpressor assignment in one of two ways: either they followed instructions and randomly assigned the other participant to a value between 1 and 9, or they decided to aggress and assign the other participant the maximum value. To model this possibility, I treated the response variable as a dichotomous outcome. Participants assigning values 1-8 were treated as one category (nonaggressive response) and participants assigning value 9 were treated as the other (aggressive response). Logistic regression was performed to test whether the odds of aggressing were influenced by the experimental assignment.

We conducted a 2 Violence × 2 Difficulty ANOVA with a logistic link function. Violence did not appear to influence aggression, `r report_z(model3, "Violence1")`. Difficulty also had a minimal effect on aggression, `r report_z(model3, "Difficulty1")`.	Application of composite irritation as a covariate to these models revealed an effect of composite irritation, `r report_z(model3.5, "feedback.NA")`, but did not increase the estimated effects of violence, difficulty, or their interaction.

Main effects of 2D:4D on aggression were again negligible. Left 2D:4D did not predict aggression, `r report_z(model1, "L2d4d_std")`, nor did right 2D:4D, `r report_z(model2, "R2d4d_std")`. Application of composite irritation as a covariate did not influence the estimated effect. Higher-order interactions of 2D:4D with factors of Violence or Difficulty were not supported by the results (all |t| < 1.53).
