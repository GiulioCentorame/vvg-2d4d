The script has been taken from the author's [[github:Joe-Hilgard/vvg-2d4d][GitHub]], as referred to by the [[https://osf.io/cwenz/][OSF link]] reported in the article. The repository has been forked [[github:GiulioCentorame/vvg-2d4d][here]] and downloaded in such form.

The authors did not provide any environment to work in, so base and installed package versions were retrieved from session_info.txt.
(We assume all the dependency for R 3.4.1 are already installed on the machine)

First, install the right version of R: 

```{bash}
export R_VERSION=3.4.1
curl -O https://cran.rstudio.com/src/base/R-3/R-${R_VERSION}.tar.gz
tar -xzvf R-${R_VERSION}.tar.gz
cd R-${R_VERSION}
./configure \
    --prefix=/opt/R/${R_VERSION} \
    --enable-memory-profiling \
    --enable-R-shlib \
    --with-blas \
    --with-lapack \
    CFLAGS=-fPIC \
    CXXFLAGS=-fPIC \
    FPICFLAGS=-fPIC \ 
    CPICFLAGS=-fPIC \
    --enable-shared

make

sudo make install
```
