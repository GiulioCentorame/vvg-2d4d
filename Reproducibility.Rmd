The script has been taken from the author's [[github:Joe-Hilgard/vvg-2d4d][GitHub]], as referred to by the [[https://osf.io/cwenz/][OSF link]] reported in the article. The repository has been forked [[github:GiulioCentorame/vvg-2d4d][here]] and downloaded in such form.

The authors did not provide any environment to work in, so base and installed package versions were retrieved from session_info.txt.
(We assume all the dependency for R 3.4.1 are already installed on the machine)

First, install the right version of R: 

```{bash}
# I am downloading it from archive.org because even the Arch archive doesn't have it anymore
# Also, I don't know why, I can't compile the source from my laptop

curl -O https://archive.org/download/archlinux_pkg_r/r-3.4.1-3-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
sudo pacman -U r-3.4.1-3-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
```
